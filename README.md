A routing library for [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) that strives for sensible API parity with [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/).

### Questions?
Feedback is appreciated, but please keep in mind that the project contains components that are currently under [active](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=ericvicenti) [development](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commits?author=hedgerwang) and considered experimentalâ€”aka use in production at your own risk. Documentation is still a [work-in-progress](https://github.com/jmurzy/react-router-native/issues), and pull requests are accepted gratefully!

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@jmurzy](https://twitter.com/jmurzy). If you have any questions, please submit an Issue with the "question" tag or come hang out in the React Router [Reactiflux Channel](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46) and post your request there.

### Platform Support

React Router Native is cross-platform. It supports all platforms that [NavigationExperimental](https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc) supports.

### Installation

_Do __not__ let npm confuse you. There used to be another project with the same name that the previous owner nuked. Unfortunately, removing or re-publishing old versions is no longer supported by npm. So the packages that are currently available on npm are the artifacts of a different project, and the first version of this library will be released as __v2.0.0__ and strictly follow [React Versioning Scheme](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html) afterwards._

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save react-router react-router-native@2.0.0
```
### Usage

```javascript
import { Router, Route, render } from 'react-router-native';

const APP_KEY = 'app'

const App = (props) => (/*...*/);
const About = (props) => (/*...*/);
const AboutHeader = (props) => (/*...*/);
const Users = (props) => (/*...*/);
const User = (props) => (/*...*/);
const UserHeader = (props) => (/*...*/);
const NoMatch = (props) => (/*...*/);

render((
  /* Address Bar can be toggled on or off by setting the addressBar prop */
  <Router addressBar>
    <TabsRoute
      path="app"
      component={App}
      transition="horizontal-pager"
    >
      <Route path="/" component={About} overlayComponent={AboutHeader}/>
      <Route path="users" component={Users} overlayComponent={UserHeader}>
        <Route path="/user/:userId" component={User}/>
      </Route>
      <Route path="*" component={NoMatch}/>
    </TabsRoute>
  </Router>
), APP_KEY);
```

### Advanced Usage

You can customize behavior of the default reducers that are used to create the `navigationState` of `<Route>` or its siblings.

This allows greater customizations on how `<Link>` behaves for a particular route and is especially useful for nested `<StackRoute>`'s where default action doesn't always lead to the intended behavior, or `<TabsRoute>`'s where double-taps should reset the `navigationState` of a nested `<StackRoute>`.

```js
const reducer = (
  state: EnhancedNavigationState,
  action: NavigationAction
): EnhancedNavigationState => ({
  /* ... */
});

<TabsRoute path="/" component={Component} reducer={reducer}/>
```
